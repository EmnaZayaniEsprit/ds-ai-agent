It is known among Italians as the \"Inno di Mameli\"—after the author of the lyrics—or as \"Fratelli d\\'Italia\"—from the song\\'s opening line. The piece, in 44 time signature and B-flat major key, has six strophes, and a refrain sung after each. The sixth group of verses, almost never performed, recalls the text of the first strophe.The song was popular during the unification of Italy and the following decades. However, after the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the republican and Jacobin connotations of \"Fratelli d\\'Italia\" were difficult to reconcile with the new state\\'s monarchic constitution. The kingdom instead chose \"Marcia Reale\"—the House of Savoy\\'s official anthem—composed by order of King Charles Albert of Sardinia in 1831.After World War II, Italy became a republic. On 12 October 1946, it chose \"Il Canto degli Italiani\" as a provisional national anthem. The song would retain this role as de facto anthem of the Italian Republic, and after many unsuccessful attempts, gained de jure status on 4 December 2017.'}, {'title': 'Il Canto degli Italiani - Wikipedia', 'href': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Canto_degli_Italiani', 'body': '\" Il Canto degli Italiani \" [a] is a patriotic song written by Goffredo Mameli and set to music by Michele Novaro in 1847, [2] currently used as the national anthem of Italy .
